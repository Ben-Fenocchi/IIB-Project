President Biden is facing an unfolding crisis amid a surge in migrants flocking to the US-Mexico border.

Mr Kenny spoke to Gray TV White House Correspondent Jon Decker about the issue. 

Mr Kenny said, “you can’t afford to be soft on borders”. 

“Joe Biden will create a lot of pain for a lot of people, as well as a lot of political problems for himself if he doesn’t fix it”. 

Mr Decker said he didn’t think there was a chance Joe Biden would look to Donald Trump’s policy idea and complete the building of the border wall.

Mr Frydenberg said JobKeeper was an “economic lifeline” in Australia’s “moment of crisis” as the COVID-19 pandemic was just beginning.

Mr Falinski said the Labor Party has an ongoing issue of electing members from similar occupational backgrounds, and insisted the same criticism could not be made of the Coalition government.

“Diversity for the Labor Party in work backgrounds is a class action lawyer,” he told Sky News.

Mr Shoebridge said Beijing is “really starting to worry” about the growing opposition to their country’s “actions and behaviour”.

“When the EU puts sanctions on individual Chinese officials that are right in the middle of directing those atrocities in Xinjiang, that gets Beijing’s attention,” he said.

“There’s growing concern that other countries are starting to see that we’re all facing the same problem with China.”

He told Sky News host Andrew Bolt the problem with China is “rooted into behaviour of the Chinese Government”.

Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics want to change this. They have developed a detection method that can be used to track quantum transmissions. Quantum information is sent over long distances in the form of photons (i.e. light particles). However, these are quickly lost. Finding out after only a partial distance whether such a photon is still on its way to its destination or has already been lost, can significantly reduce the effort required for information processing. This would make applications such as the encryption of money transfers much more practicable.",200,

It has acquired six firms in the advice sector and agreed to buy Surrey-based IFA firm Regency Investment Services in September 2020.

David Lawrence, UK chief executive at Kingswood, told International Adviser: There's a huge amount of opportunity to consolidate at all levels of size actually.

Continuing to build and executing on a pipeline of acquisition opportunities is really important to us. In locations where we have less presence, we really want to establish hubs or anchors that we can then grow from.
