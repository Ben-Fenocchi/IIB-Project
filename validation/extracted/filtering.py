Filtering utilities for extracted events.

This file applies simple scope-based filters to the extracted events
before validation is performed.

Flowchart role:
- Part of the 'Filtering & Profiling' stage on the extracted-events stream

This module does not modify event contents; it only includes or excludes
events based on predefined criteria.
